         <field name="title">What about "Premium" dry food?</field>
         <field name="description">Regulations allow very low safety and quality standards when it comes to pet food production. So big brands are focusing more on attractive labeling and marketing tricks instead of nutrient value and health. The process of manufacturing dry food is almost the same regardless of the brand; mainly meat leftovers and diseased animals, mixed with starchy filters, and processed at temperatures known to produce carcinogens. </field>
         <field name="description2">And this can all be labeled "Premium" , "Natural" and even "Organic"</field>
